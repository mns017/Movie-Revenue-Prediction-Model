# Movie-Revenue-Prediction-Model
This project uses a dataset of over 4,000 movies from IMDB and TMDB to predict a movie's box office success, classifying its gross revenue into one of four tiers. It involves an end-to-end data science pipeline: 1) extensive data cleaning and feature engineering (including creating "value scores" for actors/directors), 2) exploratory data analysis and text mining (NLP) with NLTK and WordCloud to find thematic patterns in plot summaries, and 3) systematically training, tuning, and comparing nine different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and ensembles like Random Forest. The final model (Random Forest) achieves **77.6% accuracy** on the unseen test set and is saved using `joblib` for deployment in a `movie_teller` function that can predict the revenue class of a new movie in real-time. This project was built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn**.
